## Features
### Easy Installation
Although running FBLAquiz on a modern Linux distro is recommended, it runs on any modern version of Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The only requirements are Python 3, and access to an administrator (root) account. More details can be found in [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md). The actual installation process is also very short and simple, taking at most 15 minutes, even on a slow office computer.

### Comprehensive Admin Tools
Admins of a site get access to a multitude of tools, including the ability to ban users or remotely reset passwords. Admins also get statistics on problems, such as the solve rate and number of submissions. As well, problems can be created, edited, and deleted at any time. All of these features can be accessed through the web interface. For more advanced admins, interacting with the database using sqlite3 is also possible, but not recommended.

### Fast and Lightweight
Users can get quiz results instantly after they submit. Fast and data-efficient, even on 3G connections.

### Personalized
Users can get personalized tips to help them perform better. By creating an account, users can save and view past quiz results, get access to detailed statistics, and get personalized training.

### Private and Secure
We take data security very seriously. We do not collect any data about you, the sysadmin, or any users. All data that users send to the site, including passwords and other form data are encrypted with industry-grade encryption. We also do not sell your data, and more information about how we handle user data is available in the Privacy Policy.
